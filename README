The chart was made for tests where N = 1200

Neoptimal:
    Simple implementation of multiplication of two matrices and addition.
Optimal:
    For the optimal solution I used blocked matrix multiplication an optimization for cache.
I also took pointers to iterate through my matrix.
Blas:
    I used cblas_dgemm function to multiply the matrices. For addition I did it manually.
Optimal_f:
    I used two flags: 
    -ffast-math : This option causes the preprocessor macro __FAST_MATH__ to be defined.
        It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do not require the guarantees
        of these specifications. 
    -floop-unroll-and-jam :Apply unroll and jam transformations on feasible loops.
        In a loop nest this unrolls the outer loop by some factor and fuses the resulting
        multiple inner loops.
